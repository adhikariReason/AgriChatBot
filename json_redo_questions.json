        "Crop rotation is the practice of growing different crops in the same field in successive seasons to help maintain soil health and fertility. Some best practices for crop rotation include selecting crops that have different nutrient requirements and disease susceptibilities, avoiding planting crops from the same family in consecutive years, and using cover crops to improve soil quality."

It's important to choose a pest control method that is effective but also safe for the environment and non-target organisms."
